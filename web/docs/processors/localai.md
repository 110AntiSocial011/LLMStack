You can run [LocalAI](https://localai.io) locally and use LLMStack to build AI apps on top of open source locally running LLMs.

:::note
Make sure you configured LocalAI base url and API key in LLMStack's `Settings`. Read more about using LocalAI in our [blog post](/blog/run-os-llms-on-llmstack-with-localai).
:::

`LocalAI` provides drop in replacement for `OpenAI` APIs. Refer to [OpenAI](/docs/processors/openai) for processor details and [LocalAI](https://localai.io), for the list of supported LLMs.
