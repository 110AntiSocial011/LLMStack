Published apps can be shared with other users. This allows you to share your apps with your team or with the world. You can also use this feature to share apps with your other accounts. There are three different visibility levels for a published app:

- **Private**: Only you or the people you shared the app with can see and run the app. Shared apps will show up in the `Apps Shared With You` section in LLMStack home page of the users you shared the app with.

- **Unlisted**: Anyone with the link can see the app. App will not show up in the `Discover` page.

- **Organization**: Only members of the organization you are part of can see the app.

- **Public**: Anyone can see the app. App may show up in the `Discover` page.
