There are two types of apps that can be built using LLMStack:

- **Web Apps** - Web apps are applications that perform a single task. Think of these as a workflow or a pipeline that takes in some input, processes it and returns an output. On web, these will render a web page with a form that the user can use to provide input information. The output will be rendered on the same page. These apps can be used as standalone apps using the published url, can be integrated into existing products using API or triggered from other platforms like Slack, Discord etc.

- **Chatbots** - Chatbots are conversational apps that the user can interact with using a chat interface. These apps can be deployed on the web, embedded as chatbots on other web pages, integrated into existing products using API or triggered from other platforms like Slack, Discord etc.
